# Nike Landing Page

This is a landing page project of a potential Nike website that hosts a plethora of different shoes. The code is written in React, and uses Tailwind CSS for the styling of the landing page.

### To make this project your own:
You can either,


1.  Download the zip files from this repository **(OR)**
2.  In a new terminal window in your IDE, you can clone this repository using the following command:
      
      `git clone "https://github.com/aryan-mehta05/nike-landing-page.git"`

3. Once either of these steps are done, in your root project folder run the following command

      `npm install`

      This installs all the required dependencies including Tailwind CSS.

4. Finally, after tweaking the files to your liking, you can run the project with the following command

      `npm run dev`

      Thus the landing page will be deployed locally at this address `http://localhost:5173`

      This is the default location since we are using Vite as our framework to code React.
